									<h3>Distribution</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The distribution segment continues to carry electricity from the point where transmission leaves off, that is, at the 66/33 kV level. The standard voltages on the distribution side are therefore 66kV, 33 kV, 22 kV, 11 kV and 400/230 volts, besides 6.6 kV, 3.3 kV and 2.2 kV.

						<h2>POWER MANAGMENT AND DISTRUBATION SYSTEM</h2>
						<p>Power distribution is the crucial link and the weakest in the electricity supply chain. It assumes great significance as this segment has a direct impact on the sector’s commercial viability, and ultimately on the consumers who pay for power services. The sector has been plagued by high distribution losses coupled with theft of electricity, low metering levels and poor financial health of utilities with low cost recovery. Due to this, the distribution companies have not been able to undertake corresponding investments in infrastructure augmentation.

The sector has started receiving greater attention and investment with the restructuring of the state electricity boards. Several new initiatives have been introduced to reduce aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses along with a definitive regulatory framework. Electricity Act 2003, National Electricity Policy 2005 and National Tariff Policy 2006 are important regulations governing the sector today with an aim to bring competition in the sector and improve the services to the end consumers..</p>
